We are browsing the documentation and codebase of Namada - Tendermint-based blockchain with ZK system based on similar algorithms to ZCash.

A user has a question:

<question>How to operate an IBC relayer?

Here's an answer that isn't very good. Looks like it may be incomplete, or incorrect. Look:<poor_answer>

To operate an IBC relayer, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Hermes**

Hermes is an IBC relayer developed by Informal Systems. You can install it from binaries or build it from source. The instructions are provided in the [Hermes documentation](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/installation.html).

For example, to install from binaries:

```bash
export TAG="v1.7.4-namada-beta7"
export ARCH="x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu" # or "aarch64-apple-darwin"
curl -Lo /tmp/hermes.tar.gz https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes/releases/download/${TAG}/hermes-${TAG}-${ARCH}.tar.gz
tar -xvzf /tmp/hermes.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
```

2. **Configure Hermes**

You need to create a `config.toml` file that describes the connections Hermes will be responsible for. An example configuration is provided in the [supplemental materials](supplemental-materials/hermes-config.toml).

3. **Set up the relayer account**

On each chain, you need to create a `relayer` account. For Namada, you can run:

```bash
namadaw gen --alias relayer
```

This will generate a key for the relayer account, stored in the `wallet.toml` file in the node's base directory.

4. **Add the relayer key to Hermes**

You need to add the relayer's key to Hermes using the `keys add` command:

```bash
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG keys add --chain $CHAIN_ID --key-file $WALLET_PATH
```

5. **Create IBC channel**

To create an IBC channel between the two chains, run:

```bash
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG \
  create channel \
  --a-chain $CHAIN_A_ID \
  --b-chain $CHAIN_B_ID \
  --a-port transfer \
  --b-port transfer \
  --new-client-connection --yes
```

This will create the necessary IBC client connection and channel.

6. **Start the relayer**

Finally, you can start the relayer:

```bash
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG start
```

The relayer will now monitor the chains and relay IBC packets according to the events it observes.

For more details on operating a relayer, you can refer to the [Hermes documentation](https://hermes.informal.systems/) and the [Namada docs on relaying](https://docs.namada.net/operators/ibc.html).

To answer this question we need to consult with documentation and, maybe, even some source code. We have a list of files and their tags (or sometimes the content itself).

We need to mark which files are likely to be truly instrumental for analysis and answering the problem and which are not. We'll go through each file ID and construct a JSON marking each file as 0 if it's unlikely to contain information that will be of use for answering the question, or writing the most relevant content tags if it's likely to be useful for answering.

As a reminder, here is the question once again:

<question>How to operate an IBC relayer?

Here's an answer that isn't very good. Looks like it may be incomplete, or incorrect. Look:<poor_answer>

To operate an IBC relayer, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Hermes**

Hermes is an IBC relayer developed by Informal Systems. You can install it from binaries or build it from source. The instructions are provided in the [Hermes documentation](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/installation.html).

For example, to install from binaries:

```bash
export TAG="v1.7.4-namada-beta7"
export ARCH="x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu" # or "aarch64-apple-darwin"
curl -Lo /tmp/hermes.tar.gz https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes/releases/download/${TAG}/hermes-${TAG}-${ARCH}.tar.gz
tar -xvzf /tmp/hermes.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
```

2. **Configure Hermes**

You need to create a `config.toml` file that describes the connections Hermes will be responsible for. An example configuration is provided in the [supplemental materials](supplemental-materials/hermes-config.toml).

3. **Set up the relayer account**

On each chain, you need to create a `relayer` account. For Namada, you can run:

```bash
namadaw gen --alias relayer
```

This will generate a key for the relayer account, stored in the `wallet.toml` file in the node's base directory.

4. **Add the relayer key to Hermes**

You need to add the relayer's key to Hermes using the `keys add` command:

```bash
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG keys add --chain $CHAIN_ID --key-file $WALLET_PATH
```

5. **Create IBC channel**

To create an IBC channel between the two chains, run:

```bash
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG \
  create channel \
  --a-chain $CHAIN_A_ID \
  --b-chain $CHAIN_B_ID \
  --a-port transfer \
  --b-port transfer \
  --new-client-connection --yes
```

This will create the necessary IBC client connection and channel.

6. **Start the relayer**

Finally, you can start the relayer:

```bash
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG start
```

The relayer will now monitor the chains and relay IBC packets according to the events it observes.

For more details on operating a relayer, you can refer to the [Hermes documentation](https://hermes.informal.systems/) and the [Namada docs on relaying](https://docs.namada.net/operators/ibc.html).

Please, answer the same following question, but better, including more sources that were lacking in this analysis:

</question>

Now construct the JSON for file IDs. Exclude (produce 0 values) any files that are not too likely to be of benefit to the analysis of the problem in question.

Output in the form of a JSON like
{"[id]":"3 most relevant content tags from the list per which the decision to include thus source of info was made"
,"[id]":0
# or in the case where not a short content tag, but full file contents were provided, if the content is deemed important for answering:
,"[id]":1
}

Output ends after final JSON closing tag "}" without any "closing words". Don't output [] arrays or anything like that, only "id":"tag1 tag2 tag3", "id":1, or "id":0
