<QUESTION/>

Please, provide the answer. With nice markup styling. Please, provide nice citations and links to appropriate sources and try to restrict from extrapolating too much about any material that is not provided - be okay with saying "I don't know" if you don't have the full evidence.

Don't produce markup like <document_reference index="14">blah</document_reference>, etc, don't write in tags that would be unusual to find in usual text.
