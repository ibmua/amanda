For '--pruning' the options are as follows: default: the last 362880 states are kept, pruning at 10 block intervals nothing: all historic states will be saved, nothing will be deleted (i.e. archiving node) everything: 2 latest states will be kept; pruning at 10 block intervals. custom: allow pruning options to be manually specified through 'pruning-keep-recent', and 'pruning-interval' Node halting configurations exist in the form of two flags: '--halt-height' and '--halt-time'. During the ABCI Commit phase, the node will check if the current block height is greater than or equal to the halt-height or if the current block time is greater than or equal to the halt-time. If so, the node will attempt to gracefully shutdown and the block will not be committed. In addition, the node will not be able to commit subsequent blocks. For profiling and benchmarking purposes, CPU profiling can be enabled via the '--cpu-profile' flag which accepts a path for the resulting pprof file. The node may be started in a 'query only' mode where only the gRPC and JSON HTTP API services are enabled via the 'grpc-only' flag. In this mode, Tendermint is bypassed and can be used when legacy queries are needed after an on-chain upgrade is performed. Note, when enabled, gRPC will also be automatically enabled."

It does not prompt for a password to be unlocked and it should be use only for testing purposes. kwallet and pass backends depend on external tools.

If run with --dry-run, a key would be generated (or recovered) but not stored to the local keystore. Use the --pubkey flag to add arbitrary public keys to the keystore for constructing multisig transactions. You can create and store a multisig key by passing the list of key names stored in a keyring and the minimum number of signatures required through --multisig-threshold.

For '--pruning' the options are as follows: default: the last 100 states are kept in addition to every 500th state; pruning at 10 block intervals nothing: all historic states will be saved, nothing will be deleted (i.e. archiving node) everything: all saved states will be deleted, storing only the current and previous state; pruning at 10 block intervals custom: allow pruning options to be manually specified through 'pruning-keep-recent', 'pruning-keep-every', and 'pruning-interval' Node halting configurations exist in the form of two flags: '--halt-height' and '--halt-time'. During the ABCI Commit phase, the node will check if the current block height is greater than or equal to the halt-height or if the current block time is greater than or equal to the halt-time. If so, the node will attempt to gracefully shutdown and the block will not be committed. In addition, the node will not be able to commit subsequent blocks. For profiling and benchmarking purposes, CPU profiling can be enabled via the '--cpu-profile' flag which accepts a path for the resulting pprof file. The node may be started in a 'query only' mode where only the gRPC and JSON HTTP API services are enabled via the 'grpc-only' flag. In this mode, Tendermint is bypassed and can be used when legacy queries are needed after an on-chain upgrade is performed. Note, when enabled, gRPC will also be automatically enabled."

All requests in a batch are treated equally and executed at the same swap price. The order of swap requests is ignored since the universal swap price is calculated in every batch to prevent front running. The requested swap is executed with a swap price that is calculated from the given swap price function of the pool, the other swap requests, and the liquidity pool coin reserve status. Swap orders are executed only when the execution swap price is equal to or greater than the submitted order price of the swap order. Example: $ gaiad tx liquidity swap 1 1 50000000uusd uatom 0.019 0.003 --from mykey For this example, imagine that an existing liquidity pool has with 1000000000uatom and 50000000000uusd. This example request swaps 50000000uusd for at least 950000uatom with the order price of 0.019 and swap fee rate of 0.003. A sufficient balance of half of the swap-fee-rate of the offer coin is required to reserve the offer coin fee. The order price is the exchange ratio of X/Y, where X is the amount of the first coin and Y is the amount of the second coin when their denoms are sorted alphabetically. Increasing order price reduces the possibility for your request to be processed and results in buying uatom at a lower price than the pool price. For explicit calculations, The swap fee rate must be the value that set as liquidity parameter in the current network. The only supported swap-type is 1. For the detailed swap algorithm, see https://github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity [pool-id]: The pool id of the liquidity pool [swap-type]: The swap type of the swap message. The only supported swap type is 1 (instant swap). [offer-coin]: The amount of offer coin to swap [demand-coin-denom]: The denomination of the coin to exchange with offer coin [order-price]: The limit order price for the swap order. The price is the exchange ratio of X/Y where X is the amount of the first coin and Y is the amount of the second coin when their denoms are sorted alphabetically [swap-fee-rate]: The swap fee rate to pay for swap that is proportional to swap amount.
