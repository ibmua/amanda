Namada

Namada is a network of individuals and communities united around the mission of making data protection a fundamental part of the multichain ecosystem. To make this mission a reality, the collective strength of a committed community that uses, teaches, and works together to improve data protection is essential. Namada extends an open invitation to those who resonate with this vision to become a part of its Community Builders Program.

Why Become a Community Builder?
Participation in the Community Builders Program offers individuals a direct role in sculpting the future of Namada and its societal impact. It serves as a forum for collaboration among like-minded data protection advocates, where knowledge is not just shared, but also synthesized to propel the cause of digital security.

Moreover, early adopters of the program will find themselves at a vantage point, uniquely positioned to benefit from soon-to-come initiatives. One such initiative is the upcoming Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) round, designed to recognize and reward the impactful contributions of Community Builders within the Namada ecosystem. Detailed information on the RPGF round for community builders will be available later this week.

How to Join?
To become a part of Namada's Community Builder community, individuals are invited to take the following steps:

Complete the Community Builder Form.
Follow Namada on Twitter.

For a comprehensive guide, the Namada Community Builder Handbook is available for further details on the program and how one can contribute effectively.
